# BMM350 SensorAPI - Bosch Sensortec

> This package contains Bosch Sensortec's BMM350 magnetometer SensorAPI

## Sensor Overview
The BMM350 is a 3-axis magnetic sensor which operates in automatic mode or triggered mode.
The magnetic-to-digital conversion technology is based on TMR (tunnel magneto resistance) 
The BMM350 has an excellent temperature behaviour with an outstanding low temperature coefficient of the offset (TCO) and temperature coefficient of the sensitivity (TCS).

### Applications
1. Virtual, augmented and mixed reality applications
2. High-end gaming applications
3. Platform stabilization applications such as image stabilization, or indoor navigation and dead-reckoning, for example in robotics applications. 
4. Magnetic heading information
5. Tilt-compensated electronic compass for map rotation, navigation and augmented reality
6. Gyroscope calibration in 9-DoF applications for mobile devices
7. In-door navigation, e.g. step counting in combination with accelerometer
8. Gaming (AR/VR)
